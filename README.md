# Scientific Computing with Python (Web Demo)

This project demonstrates basic scientific computing concepts inspired by Python, implemented in a modern, aquamarine-themed web page using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No terminal or installation required—just open the HTML file in your browser.

## Demonstrated Capabilities
- **Basic Python-like syntax and logic**: The interface and logic are inspired by Python's approach to scientific computing.
- **Mathematical operations and standard logic**: Includes a unit converter and a free fall simulator using formulas and logic similar to Python scripts.
- **Functions, scripts, and interactive logic**: Each section is modular and interactive, simulating Python script behavior in the browser.

## Included Projects
- **Unit Converter**: Convert between moles, joules, and pascals.
- **Free Fall Simulator (MRU/MRUV)**: Enter height and gravity to simulate and visualize free fall time and motion.
- **Text Console Game**: Play a number guessing game in a console-style interface.

## How to use this project?
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `python_index.html` in your browser.
3. Interact with the tools and games directly—no setup or terminal needed.

## File Structure
- `python_index.html`: Main HTML file with the interface.
- `python_styles.css`: Modern aquamarine styles for a clean look.
- `python_app.js`: All interactive logic and simulation code.

## Customization
You can easily add more scientific tools, change styles, or expand the logic by editing the JavaScript and CSS files.
